## Some context for the curious

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Health Research Institute of Aragon.

I received my M.Sc. in mathematics and M.Eng. in Civil Engineering at the [CFIS center](https://cfis.upc.edu/es?set_language=es), in the [Polytechnic University of Catalonia](https://www.upc.edu/en?set_language=en); whose studies are considered to be the most technically demanding in Spain.  I began my professional career in the research department of Abengoa (Abengoa Research) working on the uncertainty incorporation in mechanical system designs, such as CSPP troughs and heliostats, while attending a M.Eng. in Advanced Design in Mechanical Engineering in the [University of Seville](https://www.us.es/). Later, I moved to the academic world where I obtained my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at the [Aragon Institute of Engineering Research](https://i3a.unizar.es/en). During my Ph.D, I participated in Data Science projects in collaboration with the [Aragon Institute of Technology](https://www.ita.es/en/) and in international Data Science competitions, achieving outstanding results (top 2%).

My main current research lines are:
â€“ Mathematical modelling of Glioblastoma Multiforme microenvironment, incorporating uncertainties and cell memory in computations and estimations.
â€“ The hybridization of classical simulation techniques with new data driven approaches, allowing the incorporation of the fundamental physics in the standard artificial intelligence techniques (physically guided artificial intelligence).
â€“ Development of AI solutions in diagnosis and prognosis of health diseases, especially prostate, lung and colorectal cancer.

My goal is to use the power of Data Science tools for a deeper understanding and modelling of complex biological processes, in order to facilitate the design of new therapies in the fight against cancer, and in their use as diagnosis and prognosis tools in the medicine of the future.
